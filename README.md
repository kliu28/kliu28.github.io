Welcome to the github repository for my personal website!
I'm using Gatsby as a framework and the Material-UI components library (with some additional styling).
All my source code is on `master`, but the page is published from the `gh-pages` branch via Gatsby.

One day I hope to add more content and make this into a blog!
